# Object-Detection
A Flask web app that performs real-time person detection using a pre-trained YOLOv5 model. Users can upload images, and the app returns results with detected persons highlighted using OpenCV. Built with PyTorch, Flask, and HTML/CSS. Simple UI and REST API for integration.

Object-Detection
Object Detection Web App using YOLOv5 and Flask
This project is a web-based object detection system that identifies persons in uploaded images using the pre-trained yolov5s model from Ultralytics. Built with Flask, PyTorch, and OpenCV, the application processes uploaded images, detects persons, draws bounding boxes, and returns the result to the user.
